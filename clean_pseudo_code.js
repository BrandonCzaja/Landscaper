PSEUDO CODE

    THIS GAME CAN BE SUMMED UP JUST A FEW REPETITIVE STEPS:
        -CUT LAWN
        -CHECK BALANCE
        -BUY NEXT TOOL
        -REPEAT
        -THEN USER WINS

    THE QUESTION IS HOW DO I DO THOSE STEPS.
    -CUT LAWN WILL BE A FUNCTION THAT LOOPS OVER THE "PROCESS OF CUTTING THE LAWN" WHICH IS ACTUALLY JUST ALERTING THE USER THEY CUT THE LAWN, ADDING THE CORRESPONDING MONEY TO THE ACCOUNT BALANCE, AND ASKING THE USER IF THEY WANT TO REPEAT THIS STEP. IF THE USER HAS ENOUGH MONEY I CAN ASK THEM IF THEY WANT TO BUY THE NEXT TOOL


MOCK CODE
    -THIS COVERS CUTTING THE LAWN, UPDATING THE ACCOUNT BALANCE, AND UPGRADING TOOLS
        let currentTool = toolsArray[0];
        let payment = toolPayment[0];
        const toolCost = []
        const cutLawn = () => {
            accountBalance += payment;
            if(accountBalance >= toolCost++) {
                let toolPrompt = prompt('You have enough money to buy the next tool. Would you like to buy the next tool?');
                if(toolPrompt === 'yes') {
                    currentTool++ 
                } else {
                    cutLawn();
                }
            }
            let response = prompt('you cut one lawn and got paid' + payment '. Would you like to cut another?', 'yes or no');   => payment = toolPayment[]
                if(response === 'yes') {
                    cutLawn();
                } else {
                    alert('sorry you are broke and cannot refuse this job');

                STAGE OF THE GAME:
                -USER OWNS A TEAM
                -ACCOUNT BALANCE += 250 FOR EACH LAWN CUT (loop)


                CONDITIONALS TO CHECK:
                -THERE AREN'T REALLY ANY CONDITIONALS TO CHECK BECAUSE AT THIS POINT OF THE GAME THEY HAVE THE TEAM 
                -I COULD MERGE A FINAL CONDITIONAL IN THIS STAGE TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CONDITIONAL CHECK OF THE LAST STAGE (do I own team and balance)
                -I GUESS I COULD ASK THE USER IF THEY WANT TO CUT GRASS AS A CONDITIONAL


                THINGS I NEED TO CODE
                -A LOOP FOR THE BALANCE (declare at start)
                -A FUNCTION THAT CONTINUES CUTTING THE GRASS - WHICH ACTUALLY JUST UPDATES BALANCE AND TOOLS (declared in start)




                MOCK CODE
                -ACCOUNT BALANCE (this function would probably have been declared in step 1)
                    const accountBalance = (number) => {
                        for(every time I run the cutGrass function){
